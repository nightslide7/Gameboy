Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     7 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   7
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         14 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       14 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              14

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     4 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           14
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             7 out of      14   50%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      14    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           7 out of      14   50%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               1 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        11 out of     640    1%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       11 out of      11  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.22

Peak Memory Usage:  1029 MB
