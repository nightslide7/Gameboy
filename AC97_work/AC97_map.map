    Number used as logic:                      397 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             263
      Number using O5 output only:              67
      Number using O5 and O6:                   67
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         6
  Number of route-thrus:                        73

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   147 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          461
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           207 out of     461   44%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  58 out of     461   12%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         196 out of     461   42%
    Number of unique control sets:              35
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              46 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        59 out of     640    9%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       58 out of      59   98%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      5 out of      32   15%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        5

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.75

Peak Memory Usage:  1123 MB
